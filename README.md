# Advanced-Web-and-Javascript-And-API-Management-project
This project is real world application. This application is mainly about reviewing the movies. User can give the reviews for the movies which are uploaded in our application. The application is divided in two sides, the user and movies definition on one side and the movies ratings on the other side. Users and movies definitions: Users will be stored in the Relational Database. Each user has some privileges defined by a role. Movies also are defined in the database. Each movie can have an author, a release date, a type. The information that a User has seen a movie is indicated in an association table. Each user definition has some administrative information attached, defining a Contact. Each Contact has a billing address, a first name, last name, phone number and an email address. An address is composed of the Country, Area, City, Street and Street number to setup the whole infrastructure to achieve this. Features: The application should be able to implement the following scenarii: user authentication welcome page with last seen films, new movies and recommendations play film (mock) rate film compute stats (10 most popular movies, 10 most viewed movies).
